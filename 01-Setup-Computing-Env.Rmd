# Setup the Computing Environment

## Install R

We recommend install R before install Anaconda Python, as the later will pollute the system environment (for instance, it might throw the `libcurl` version error.)

After downloading the source code from https://www.r-project.org:

```{r build-R, eval=FALSE}
# configuration
# run ./configure --help to see all available options
./configure --prefix=/apps/R/R-x.y.z --enable-memory-profiling \
    --enable-R-profiling

# build and install R
make 
make install
```
