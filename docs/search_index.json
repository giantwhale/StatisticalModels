Even though the later is better optimized, it fails to install packages with compiled code, (see https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-r-open/issues/17). The solution is to install packages in regular R and use a shared library directory for both R instances. We recommend install R before install Anaconda Python, as the later will pollute the system environment (for instance, it might throw the libcurl version error.) After downloading the source code from https://www.r-project.org: # configuration # run ./configure --help to see all available options ./configure --prefix=/apps/R/R-x.y.z --enable-memory-profiling \\ --enable-R-profiling \\ --enable-R-shlib # build and install R make make install # Specify the directory for R packages. This is only needed if we # want to install Microsoft R-Open as well. mkdir -p /apps/R/lib-x.y.z echo &#39;.libPaths(&quot;/apps/R/lib-x.y.z&quot;)&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.Rprofile # now run R /apps/R/R-x.y.z/bin/R --version 1.2 Install Python 1.3 Writing Notes with R::bookdown 1.3.1 Create a new book on Github Follow the steps below to write a book named Statistical Models.
